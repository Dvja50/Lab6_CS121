Part 2 starts by creating an empty list of students. It loads student data from students.csv using loadStudents(), which reads each line, creates a Student object, 
and adds it to the list. The program then shows a menu where the user can choose to print student names (showStudentNames()), print full student details (printStudents()),
or search for a student by last name (findStudent()). If the user enters an invalid option, they are prompted again. 
The menu keeps appearing until the user chooses 0 to exit. Before closing, the program calls delStudents() to free memory and prevent leaks.
 Create an empty list of Student pointers (students)  
    Call loadStudents(students) to read data from "students.csv"  

    WHILE user does not choose to quit  
        Display menu options  
        Get user choice  

        IF choice is "1"  
            Call showStudentNames(students) to display student names  
        ELSE IF choice is "2"  
            Call printStudents(students) to display full student data  
        ELSE IF choice is "3"  
            Call findStudent(students) to search by last name  
        ELSE  
            Print "Invalid Input"  

    Call delStudents(students) to free memory
